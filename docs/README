BUILD
======

1.make TARGET=x86 will build for x86
2.default build is for arm.
3.Edit install-path-$(TARGET) tool-path-$(TARGET) and
root-path-$(TARGET) to point your build paths.
where $(TARGET) is arm for example.
3.for x86 no $(TARGET) prefix is added.

TIPS for build
==============
1.if libncurses.a already exist please rename it otherwise
build will break because we are using latest libncurses which
has lot of new functions.
type:
strip linphonec           for x86 
arm-linux-strip linphonec for arm
